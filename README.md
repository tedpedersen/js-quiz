# js-quiz
A dynamic quiz of Javascript questions. There are 4 questions worth 25 points each, the user has 100 seconds to answer. If a user gets a question wrong, 10 seconds is subtracted from the timer. If the timer runs out, the game ends. The user's score is saved in local storage. The user can view the score by clicking "See High Scores", a validation is run to make sure there is a score in local storage, if not the users gets a  alert, if so the results are shown.

I used bootstrap for the scaffolding, and my own custom styles on top of that.
